# Fruit Classification Project

This project implements a fruit classification system using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The goal is to classify different types of fruits based on features like weight and color scores.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of fruit samples stored in a text file (`fruit.txt`). Each sample includes multiple features such as weight and color scores, along with a label representing the fruit type.

## Features

- Weight
- Color Score 1
- Color Score 2
- Other numeric features from the dataset

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruit-classification.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

3. Place the dataset file (`fruit.txt`) in the appropriate folder. Update the file path in the script if needed.

4. Run the Python script:
   
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## Results

The program outputs the accuracy of each model on training and testing data and predicts the fruit label for new samples based on their features.
